## Run Instructions
    1) Pull the Working branch to your local repository
        - DO NOT pull the master branch. At any given time the working branch is
        the most up-to-date working version of the program and should always be
        the branch pulled from
    2) Run 'npm install' from within the root directory
        - This will install any new dependencies since the last time you pulled
        the branch
    3) Run 'node server.js'
        - This should give a message about a DeprecationWarning which is fine,
        then give a message about listening on port 3000, then state it is
        'Connected...'
    4) Open a browser. On the URL line enter 'localhost:3000'
    4) The page should load center on the ODU campus with the new interface
