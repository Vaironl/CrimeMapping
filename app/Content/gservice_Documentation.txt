Purpose:
    To communicate with the Google Maps API. Creates map and heatmap and loads with data upon load
    and refresh.

Variables:
    googleMapsService       - contains handler function for map refresh (*See Functions below)
    crimes                  - list of Crime objects obtained directly from our db
                              will be cleared and refilled with crimes every time map changes

Functions:
    googleMapService.refresh()      - called whenever map is refreshed by client (ex: zoom in or out)
                                      creates google.maps.Map (map) object
                                      creates google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer (heatmap) object
                                      and loads them to the maps event listener.

    getPoints()                     - inputs crimes (list of Crimes) and returns a list of google.maps.LatLng objects
                                      that come from the crimes

    getNewRadius()                  - converts radius from meters to pixels based on zoom level of map
